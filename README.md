## New Technologies Project

## Description
Duration: weekend research

The purpose of this project was to look into technologies that I haven't used before, research them, and build a small project. I created a basic "Hello World"-style program that incorporates a for loop, an if statement, and a counter that gets incremented. I had some extra time, looked into neural networks, and did a code-along to set up a basic neural network.

## Technologies Used
- Python https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
- NumPy (conda install numpy)

## What I Learned
tl;dr - I learned about Python syntax, what Jupyter Notebook is (though my project was completed in Visual Studio Code), and how a basic neural network works. Finding learning materials that were at an intermediate level (both math and Python/Jupyter knowledge) was difficult.

Python is a programming language that can be used to develop a wide variety things from websites to apps to AI. Python allows the user to focus on the specific thing they're building by taking care of universally-present programming tasks in the background. It is comparable to Javascript, which is what we are learning at Prime. However, unlike Javascript Python is strict-typed and much more object-oriented to improve project scalability. Our weekend project was to research new technologies (read: that we have no experience with) and build a small project with those technologies. NumPy is a Python library that assists with arrays and mathematics. Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web app that a user can create and share (live) code with.

Shortly before starting at Prime I listened to some music that was being generated 24/7 by a neural network in a live stream on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwtVkPKx3RA). It was fascinating, and at that moment I made a goal to look into how neural networks work and how to create one once I had more foundational programming knowledge. My goal for the weekend was to delve back into that realm, see what technologies are used, and create a basic "Hello World!" script. I started off with Jeff Heaton's videos (https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning), but did not like his teaching style. Eventually I found this playlist (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzWaow1Rvho&list=PLxt59R_fWVzT9bDxA76AHm3ig0Gg9S3So). The math was beyond my comprehension, but I the basic idea made sense. I was going to call it a weekend, but then I found this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kft1AJ9WVDk and everything was explained in much more simple terms.

The most challenging part of this was finding material that wasn't too basic but at the same time wasn't too technical. Neural networks and macine learning in general is so fascinating. In the future I want to continue learning about them so I can reate all sorts of bizarre things.
